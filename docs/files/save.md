# Save Files

This is Dead Cells' specific binary save file format. It stores multiple serialised objects in a compressed format along with hashes to prevent corruption or tampering.

:::note

All this information was obtained from `f@34927 static tool.$Save.genSave (User, Bool) -> haxe.io.Bytes` - if you'd like to help out, try looking at this function yourself!

:::

:::warning

This is not complete! We still need to figure out how hxbit actually stores its data, and until then, save files can only be partially modified.

:::

A working example of reading and writing a Dead Cells save file is available in `alivecells` as [`savetool.py`](https://github.com/N3rdL0rd/alivecells/blob/main/savetool.py).

### Payload

The payload is a Zlib-compressed blob that contains the actual save file - some of them are [hxbit](https://github.com/HeapsIO/hxbit) serialised data, and others are just raw bits and pieces. They follow the order of the data chunk flags that were set previously - basically, if a data chunk flag was `1`, then the chunk is present in the save file. The payload is compressed with Zlib level 9 (maximum) compression. To manipulate it, read it as follows:

- Decompress the payload (it has headers, so any stock zlib implementation can handle it)
- Figure out how many data chunks are enabled
- For each of those data chunks that's enabled, read a [Chunk](#chunk) from the payload blob, seeking forward in it as you do.

### Chunk

| Size (bytes) | Name           | Description                                        | Struct            |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 4            | Size           | Size of the contents                               | Unsigned 32-bit integer |
| Variable     | Contents       | Raw bytes of the save file chunk contents          | Varies, see [Chunk Formats](#chunk-formats) |

## Chunk Formats

Depending on what kind of data chunk you're reading, the format of its chunk in the save file changes. Here's a basic map:

| Bit | Name | Type |
|----|-----|-----|
| 0 | `S_User` | [hxbit Data](#hxbit-data) |
| 1 | `S_Game` | [hxbit Data](#hxbit-data) |
| 2 | `S_UserAndGameData` | [hxbit Data](#hxbit-data) |
| 3 | `S_Date` | [Date Chunk](#date-chunk) |
| 7 | `S_VersionNumber` | [VersionNumber Chunk](#versionnumber-chunk) |

### Date Chunk

| Size (bytes) | Name           | Description                                        | Struct            |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 8            | Date           | Date of save file creation as a unix timestamp     | Double            |

### VersionNumber Chunk

| Size (bytes) | Name           | Description                                        | Struct            |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 4            | Version        | Major game version for this save file, eg `34` or `35` | 32-bit float  |

## hxbit Data

This data is serialised with help from [hxbit](https://github.com/HeapsIO/hxbit) - a Haxe library that enables serialisation of arbitrary objects to binary representations. This has yet to be reversed, but if it were able to be, it would be the key to actually modifying save files.

## Additional notes about saves from the mobile version

The chunks `S_Game` and `S_UserAndGameData` cannot be copied from a PC save to a mobile save, because mobile has no implementation of the Twitch integration features; those Twitch features are always referenced in those two chunks on a PC save even when they have not been activated, leading to a crash when trying to pass them on the mobile version.

However, the `S_User` chunk, which contains the meta progress of the save (including unlocked items), can be passed from a PC save to a mobile save.
