# Xbox One/Series X/Series S

Unfortunately, I'm unable to find a source that allows me to legally obtain the files for Dead Cells on Xbox. If anyone owns an Xbox with Dead Cells installed, please send me a DM on Discord `@n3rdl0rd` - let's figure this out!

Notably, the Xbox holds a lot of promise as an x64-based system that very very closely mimics Windows' systems, so if any console has a full bytecode image embedded on it, this would be the one.
