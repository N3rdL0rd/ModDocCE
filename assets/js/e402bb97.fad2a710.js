Assuming you have a title.keys and a prod.keys dumped (\ud83d\ude09) from a Switch, you can extract both the game\'s main (a custom-format NSO executable) and its res.pak with NxFileViewer.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"console/ps4":{"id":"console/ps4","title":"PS4/5","description":"Dead Cells on the PS4/5 is shipped as a signed PKG. Inside of the PKG, there are native interfaces for all trophies (achievements), alongside a SELF (Signed ELF) binary that acts as the main entry point (eboot.bin) and the obligatory res.pak, which seems to be V0 but could possibly be V1.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"console/xbox":{"id":"console/xbox","title":"Xbox One/Series X/Series S","description":"Unfortunately, I\'m unable to find a source that allows me to legally obtain the files for Dead Cells on Xbox.

The corresponding file format, often with an .hxs extension, is designed for speed and efficiency, using a compact binary representation instead of a more verbose text-based format. This makes it ideal for applications requiring fast loading times and a small data footprint, such as games and networked applications.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"files/pak":{"id":"files/pak","title":"PAK files","description":"PAK files are checksum-verified packages that contain a full filesystem structure inside them - they store all assets for the game. PAK files can be layered on top of each other - the game will first search for res.pak, then res1.pak, then res2.pak (etc.) while loading PAKs - PAKs are incrementally stacked on top of each other during the loading process - conflicts are ignored, and the PAK with the highest priority is used.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"files/save":{"id":"files/save","title":"Save Files","description":"This is Dead Cells\' specific binary save file format. It stores multiple serialised objects in a compressed format along with hashes to prevent corruption or tampering.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Home","description":"Welcome to ModDocCE - the community edition of the ubiquitous Dead Cells ModsDoc.pdf!

This has yet to be investigated further, but it\'s worth looking into, as it may show promise for PAK modification.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/crashlink":{"id":"tutorials/crashlink","title":"Using crashlink","description":"crashlink is a new HashLink bytecode Swiss Army knife that allows you to easily (and programatically) load, save, modify, patch, decompile, and otherwise poke at compiled Haxe in HashLink.
