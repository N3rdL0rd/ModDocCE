PAK files can be layered on top of each other - the game will first search for res.pak, then res1.pak, then res2.pak (etc.) while loading PAKs - PAKs are incrementally stacked on top of each other during the loading process - conflicts are ignored, and the PAK with the highest priority is used.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"files/save":{"id":"files/save","title":"Save Files","description":"This is Dead Cells\' specific binary save file format.

This has yet to be investigated further, but it\'s worth looking into, as it may show promise for PAK modification.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/crashlink":{"id":"tutorials/crashlink","title":"Using crashlink","description":"crashlink is a new HashLink bytecode Swiss Army knife that allows you to easily (and programatically) load, save, modify, patch, decompile, and otherwise poke at compiled Haxe in HashLink.
